    <h1>The impact of Artificial Intelligence on Survival Rates in Early Detection of Lung Cancer</h1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>AI in early detection of lung cancer</h2>
    <p>
      Due to large advancements in AI technology, the healthcare industry is making progress to implement AI to better diagnose lung cancer. This is because lung cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose, yet early diagnosis is critical to the patient's survival rate. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Lung cancer is the most diagnosed cancer type in the world, with over 2.48 million new diagnoses in 2022 alone. The survival rate is closely tied to the stage at which the cancer is diagnosed. In the first two stages of lung cancer, the survival rates are 90 to 56 percent, but in the last two stages, they drop to around 41 to 0 percent. It is extremely difficult to detect lung cancer at early stages due to the lack of symptoms experienced, which is why more than 70 percent of diagnoses are at stage 3 or 4. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Opportunity</h2>
    <p>
      There are lots of opportunities to implement AI for lung cancer diagnosis. Some of the more notable opportunities include early detection, increased survival rate of cancer patients, and more. For example, implementing AI to help lung cancer detection could help diagnose lung cancer earlier and more accurately compared to traditional methods. This is because AI can find patterns in massive amounts of data that humans aren’t able to. By detecting lung cancer earlier, it would greatly increase lung cancer survival rate since lung cancer is only so deadly because it’s often detected too late for any effective treatment.
