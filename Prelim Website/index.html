        The impact of Artificial Intelligence on Survival Rates in Early
        Detection of Lung Cancer

      <h2>Abstract</h2>

      <p>
        Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type. Because the
        survival rate is closely linked to how soon the cancer is found, most
        people not showing symptoms until stage 3 (Sandeep, Ramakrishnan, &
        Murali, 2024), and early-stage lung cancer is difficult for even
        professionals to detect (Choudhury et al., 2025). The healthcare
        industry is working to implement AI to help diagnose lung cancer
        earlier.
        <br />
        There are lots of opportunities to implement AI for lung cancer
        diagnosis. Some of the more notable opportunities include early
        detection, increased survival rate of cancer patients, and more. For
        example, implementing AI to help lung cancer detection could help
        diagnose lung cancer earlier and more accurately compared to traditional
        methods (Leonard et al., 2020). This is because AI can find patterns in
        massive amounts of data that humans are not able to (Li et al., 2022).
        By detecting lung cancer earlier, it would increase lung cancer survival
        rate since lung cancer is only so deadly because it is often detected
        too late for any effective treatment (Choudhury et al., 2025).
        Furthermore, early detection of lung cancer will also increase the
        affordability of treatment, lessening the financial burden on patients
        and their families.
        <br />
        There are also potential risks that are involved with the introduction
        of AI for lung cancer diagnosis. Overdiagnosis is a potential risk that
        we could see since there was overdiagnosis with LDCT screening, and
        AI-assisted screening showed a higher sensitivity, which could mean that
        AI-based screening would increase the risk of overdiagnosis. The next
        risk is wider health inequalities, as AI may only be cost-effective if
        it costs a low amount in a pay-per-case setting or receives frequent use
        (Du et al., 2023), which lower-income healthcare systems may not be able
        to achieve. Additionally, implementation challenges are frequent
        overlooked (Istasy et al., 2022), which may potentially result in
        low-income healthcare systems being unable to implement AI. Finally,
        AI-based models were found to have an increased bias when compared to
        regression models, and bias can occur at different stages (Sourlos et
        al., 2022), all of which may increase the risk false-positives for
        underrepresented groups.
        <br />
        Overall, there are lots of challenges involving lung cancer detection
        AI, as a result many choices will have to be made in order to overcome
        them. For example, one of the challenges would be privacy and data
        collection. By complying with different regulations, the accuracy of AI
        will be reduced due to random data and more (Vota et al., 2025). On the
        other hand, not complying with regulations and prioritizing data will
        violate privacy and cause distrust in the AI lung cancer detection
        technologies among the community. As a result, a choice must be made in
        the specification of regulation and the direction of advancement to
        improve AI detection. There are also many other choices that must be
        made because of the challenges that come with introducing AI that
        detects lung cancer into the medical and health industry.
