      <h2>Overdiagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Overdiagnosis represents a significant concern in cancer care (Viviana
        et al., 2025), and with the introduction of AI-based screening
        technologies, it may potentially further increase the risk.
        <br />
        According to Patz et al. (2013), a trial involving 53,452 high-risk
        individuals for lung cancer over a 6.4-year observation period to
        estimate overdiagnosis numbers between low-dose computed tomography
        (LDCT) and chest radiography (CXR), estimated that 18.5% of all lung
        cancer types detected by LDCT were overdiagnosis. Furthermore, Chao et
        al. (2022) found that AI algorithm-assisted CT screening increased the
        overall sensitivity from 67.7% to 88.4% when compared to LDCT. Given
        that overdiagnosis is already an existing issue in LDCT screening, and
        AI-assisted screening displays a higher sensitivity, there is a
        potential that AI-based screening could further escalate the risk of
        overdiagnosis.
        <br />
        However, there is currently no evidence linking AI screening to
        overdiagnosis. Additionally, Du et al. (2022) claims that when compared
        to physicians, AI had 4.12% better accuracy, 4.68% better sensitivity,
        equal specificality, 4.68% better Youden index, an increased kappa by
        0.104, a significantly shorter detection time, but a 0.023 decrease in
        area under the curve (AUC). Given equal specificity, it would suggest
        that there would not be an increase in overdiagnosis due to false
        positives, although the increased sensitivity could increase in number
        of indolent tumours detected, resulting in overdiagnosis.

      <h2>Wider Heath Inequalities</h2>
      <p>
        The adoption of AI screening carries the potential to increase existing
        health inequalities. According to Du et al. (2023), it was concluded
        that to break even on the one-time investment of 51,616 euros on their
        deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (DL-CAD), a volume of 12,300 to
        53,600 CT scans would be required for concurrent reading while
        pre-screening reading would require 9,400 to 65,000 scans, across the
        USA, UK, and Poland.
        <br />
        Additionally, to break even, the author mentioned that their investment
        in the DL-CAD software would need to be used in high-volume settings or
        in a pay-per-case setting that would need to cost significantly lower
        than 6 euros (Du et al., 2023), which may not be achievable for a
        lower-income or underdeveloped healthcare system due to lower patient
        volume and a smaller budget.
        <br />
        In addition, a frequent problem is that the necessary infrastructure and
        personnel are overlooked when implementing the AI technologies (Istasy
        et al., 2022). There are also unforeseen issues with implementation,
        such as the cost of maintenance, the need for trained personnel to
        operate the AI technology, and widespread internet access (Istasy et
        al., 2022), which lower-income healthcare systems may not be able to
        afford, thereby contributing to the widening of health inequalities.
        <br />
        However, according to Tu et al. (2025), the stacking model outperformed
        the multivariate regression model, achieving a 3% improvement in the
        area under the curve (AUC), which could suggest that the implementation
        of AI-based screening may have a positive impact on patients, and in
        certain contexts, could outweigh the associated risks.

      <h2>Bias</h2>
      <p class="">
        AI screening comes with the potential risk of bias, which may contribute
        to overdiagnosis.
        <br />
        According to Leonard et al. (2023), AI-based models exhibited an 83%
        high bias rate, whereas the traditional regression model had a 66% high
        bias rate.
      </p>

      <p class="">
        Additionally, bias is not restricted to just the training phase, but
        rather, there are multiple different phases in model development and
        evaluation where bias can occur, and with each phase containing multiple
        types of bias (Sourlos et al., 2022).
      </p>
      <img src="../images/bias_image_2.jpg" alt="" class="image_02" />
      <p class="">
        Due to this bias, underrepresented groups may face an increased risk of
        false-positive results, leading to overdiagnosis. According to Toft et
        al. (2019), overdiagnosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening resulted
        in anxiety, discomfort, changed self-perception and behaviour, and
        reconsiderations on screening participation. Similar consequences may
        occur with patients who received an overdiagnosis of lung cancer, which
        may negatively impact the patientâ€™s standard of living.
        <br />
        Conversely, findings reported by Thong et al. (2022) found that AI
        showed high accuracy in detecting lung cancer, additionally, it was
        found to be accurate across a variety of different imaging datasets and
        collection contexts. Although it was acknowledged that the data quality
        was poor (Thong et al., 2022), indicating that there may not have been
        enough testing.
