      <h2>Technology Risks</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are many risks for implementation of AI into cancer diagnosis,
        Because of the information required for training for effective AI
        recognition algorithms many patients may need to be required to
        volunteer or to test on for accurate cancer diagnosis. After algorithms
        have been trained the increased digitalisation makes hospitals more
        dependent on electricity which could be dangerous during blackout
        emergencies. The infrastructure AI requires such as servers or steady
        internet access will also be costly. Continuous costs such as
        maintenance and monetisation from private companies of such models could
        put heavy strain on the already overstretched state healthcare budget.
        It could further widen health inequalities based on wealth or location
        favouring either rich or city populations. The lack of generalizability
        of the data could be prevalent, AI trained on data from one set of the
        population could cause false diagnoses in other population groups, such
        as people from different ethnicities, age groups, or places with
        differing amounts of funding and available medical equipment. General
        trust from the population will also be an issue. Under the New Zealand
        Bill of Rights Act “Everyone has the right to refuse to undergo any
        medical treatment.”, this will also extend to treatment using AI systems
        causing hospitals to not only see limited usage of a costly treatment
        but will also worsen the access to training data thus reducing the
        effectiveness for the entire population.
