      <h2 class="text_01 topic_subtitle">Overdiagnosis</h2>
      <p class="text_01">
        According to Patz et al. (2013), a trial involving 53,452 high-risk
        individuals for lung cancer over a 6.4-year observation period to
        estimate overdiagnosis numbers between low-dose computed tomography
        (LDCT) and chest radiography (CXR), estimated that 18.5% of all lung
        cancer types detected by LDCT were overdiagnosis. Furthermore, Chao et
        al. (2022) found that AI algorithm-assisted CT screening increased the
        overall sensitivity from 67.7% to 88.4% when compared to LDCT. Given
        that overdiagnosis is already an existing issue in LDCT screening, and
        AI-assisted screening displays a higher sensitivity, there is a
        potential that AI-based screening could further escalate the risk of
        overdiagnosis. However, there is currently no evidence linking AI
        screening to overdiagnosis. Additionally, Du et al. (2022) claims that
        when compared to physicians, AI had 4.12% better accuracy, 4.68% better
        sensitivity, equal specificality, 4.68% better Youden index, an
        increased kappa by 0.104, a significantly shorter detection time, but a
        0.023 decrease in area under the curve (AUC). Given equal specifically,
        it would suggest that there would not be an increase of overdiagnosis
        due to false positives, although the increased sensitivity could result
        in an increase of indolent tumours being detected, resulting in
        overdiagnosis.

      <h2 class="text_01 topic_subtitle">Wider Heath Inequalities</h2>
      <p class="text_01">
        By using AI-based screening, we would see a widening of health
        inequalities. According to Du et al. (2023), it was concluded that to
        break even on the one-time investment of 51,616 euros on their deep
        learning computer-aided diagnosis (DL-CAD), a volume of 12,300 to 53,600
        CT scans would be required for concurrent reading while pre-screening
        reading would require 9,400 to 65,000 scans, across the USA, UK, and
        Poland. Additionally, to break even, the author mentioned their
        investment in the DL-CAD software “must be priced substantially below 6
        euro in a pay-per-case setting or must be used in high-workload
        environments”, which wouldn’t be achievable for a lower-income or
        underdeveloped healthcare system due to lower patient volume and a
        smaller budget. In addition, “a recurrent problem noted in the
        literature is the lack of consideration for the infrastructure and human
        resources necessary to implement these AI technologies” (Istasy et al.,
        2022). There are unforeseen issues with implementation, such as the cost
        of maintenance, the need for trained personnel to operate the AI
        technology, and widespread internet access (Istasy et al., 2022), which
        lower-income healthcare systems may not be able to afford, thereby
        contributing to the widening of health inequalities.

        However, according to Tu et al. (2025), the stacking model outperformed
        the multivariate regression model, achieving a 3% improvement in the
        area under the curve (AUC), which could suggest that the implementation
        of AI-based screening may have a positive impact on patients, and in
        certain contexts, could outweigh the associated risks.

      <h2 class="text_01 topic_subtitle">Bias</h2>
      <p class="text_01">
        AI models are often trained on specific populations of people, where
        minorities are not being represented. According to Leonard et al.
        (2023), AI-based models exhibited a 83% high bias rate, whereas the
        traditional regression model had a 66% high bias rate. Additionally,
        bias is not restricted to just the training phase, but rather, there are
        multiple different phases in model development and evaluation where bias
        can occur, and with each phase containing multiple types of bias
        (Sourlos et al., 2022).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text_01">
        Due to this bias, underrepresented groups may face an increased risk of
        false positives. This results in overdiagnosis, leading to anxiety,
        discomfort, changed self-perception and behaviour, and reconsiderations
        on screening participation (Toft et al., 2019), which may negatively
        impact the patient’s standard of living.
      </p>

      <p class="text_01">
        Conversely, findings reported by Thong et al. (2022) found that AI
        showed high accuracy in detecting lung cancer, additionally, it was
        found to be accurate across a variety of different imaging datasets and
        collection contexts. Although it was acknowledged that the data quality
        was poor (Thong et al., 2022), indicating that there may not have been
        enough testing.
