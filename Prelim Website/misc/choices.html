      <h2>High implementation cost</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="">Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) has a high implementation cost. Due to the
        decreased funding in healthcare implementation of new technologies will
        overburden the increasingly minimal budget of public state healthcare.
        The infrastructure required for AI necessitates the high direct cost of
        installation of equipment and training, further human resources and AI
        maintenance personnel, and possibly AI usage authorisation payments in a
        pay-per-use model (Du et al., 2023; Cortiana et al., 2025). In
        conclusion, while AI can be revolutionary in how we diagnose lung cancer
        costs will have to be significantly reduced before we can implement AI
        heavily into modern healthcare systems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Choices</h3>
      <p>
        Due to heavy cost of implementation in artificial intelligence related
        to lung cancer, choices must be made to ensure maximum benefits and
        minimum costs. One of the options would be to further develop AI so it
        becomes more affordable and efficient. Currently AI technology in lung
        cancer is not yet mature, it has issues with generalisability (Li et
        al., 2022) and bias (Leonard et al., 2025) so waiting for further
        development could result in solving these problems.
        <br />
        However, AI is still proven to be superior to traditional methods in
        helping with lung cancer detection (Li et al., 2022; Leonard et al.,
        2025). While waiting for development, AI will be unable to help with
        lung cancer until it is implemented.
        <br />
        Another option when faced with cost of implementing would be to gather
        financial resources through different methods and slowly implement AI in
        the field of lung cancer. Leonard et al. (2025) show that AI outperforms
        traditional methods in helping detect lung cancer. Similarly, AI is also
        shown to be better suited to analyzing vast amounts of data than the
        human brain (Li et al., 2022) allowing better detection of lung cancer.
        <br />
        On the other hand, AI is not a developed technology. It is shown that AI
        has quite a few issues like bias (Leonard et al., 2025) and
        generalisability (Li et al., 2022). Implementing AI now could lead to
        misdiagnosis because of present issues.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Data collection</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="">Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Data collection is an obstacle to the implementation of artificial
        intelligence in the early detection of lung cancer. Firstly, the data
        required for accurate detection demands significant datasets (Moon et
        al., 2020). Consequently, numerous volunteers or test trials are
        required for data collection, resulting in precise systems that are
        safely applicable in the medical field. In addition, data requires
        proper management to ensure the privacy of the participants involved;
        improper storage systems can cause vulnerabilities prompting data leaks
        of delicate participant information. Vota et al. (2025) express the
        strict regulatory obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and
        Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General Data
        Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union subject AI processing
        facilities to stringent regulations. Ensuring compliance with these
        regulations may necessitate data obfuscation in the form of erroneous or
        random data reducing the accuracy and effectiveness of AI systems (Vota
        et al., 2025).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Choices</h3>
      <p>
        The challenge of data collection and management when implementing AI to
        help lung cancer detection will need to be addressed. As a result, a
        choice must be made on how data will be managed and collected. There is
        no perfect solution on how data collection and management could be done.
        <br />
        One of the options when it comes to data collection would be
        prioritising data collection. Accurate detection of lung cancer required
        vast amounts of datasets (Moon et al., 2020). Gathering more data will
        result in higher accuracy which could save more people who might suffer
        from lung cancer.
        <br />
        Another option when it comes to data collection would be to prioritise
        privacy. By prioritising privacy, it protects the rights of the
        community and creates more trust and transparency. However, this may
        lower the accuracy of AI lung detection technologies. Vota et al. (2025)
        expressed how compliance with regulation will reduce accuracy of AI due
        to random data and more. Lung cancer detection in AI required vast
        amounts of datasets (Moon et al., 2020), that is simply more difficult
        to gather when prioritising privacy. Overall, prioritising privacy
        protects people rights and garners more trust at the cost of data
        accumulation.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <h2>Trust</h2>
      <br />
      <h3 class="">Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        In addition, getting people to trust the implemented AI is a challenge.
        Reis et al. (2024) states, the populous has a higher perception of
        humans in reliability of the information, empathy and care of the
        practitioner, and higher willingness to follow the advice if no AI is
        involved in the process. People also perceive their individual
        characteristics are not adequately considered with AI generated medical
        advice (Reis et al., 2024). Aversions to AI will increase costs with
        limited access to data and less efficient utilisation of capital. These
        compounded problems will limit the sectors to which AI can be
        implemented.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Choices</h3>
      <p>
        There may be choices we can make to help the community trust AI more and
        ensure the things that people are worried about won't happen. Research
        has shown one of the reasons why people donâ€™t trust AI is because they
        feel like their individual situations are not carefully considered with
        AI involved (Reis et al., 2024). As a result, we could choses to give
        patients the right to express their concerns and give professionals the
        right to change the weight and the copy of data for AI detection, to
        best match the patient's situation.
