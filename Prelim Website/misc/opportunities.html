<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p>According to the (world cancer research fund, 2025) there has been around 2.4 million new cases of lung cancer and 1.8 million lung cancer deaths globally in 2022 alone. To reduce this staggering death count, early and accurate detection is crucial (Anuradha et al., 2025) and this is where technology plays in. Artificial Intelligence is a powerful asset in this fight, because it can process massive amounts of complex data that is simply beyond the human brain. It can use all those data like CT scans, self-reported symptoms and more to find patterns for lung cancer. It has the potential to provide valuable insight for doctors and scientists to aid in early diagnosis (Yawei et all, 2022). Over the years there have been many improvements in Artificial Intelligence whether it is data sets, Machine Learning, deep learning, large language model or other advancements. Today, there are a wide range of models capable of utilizing different types of data. Overall artificial intelligence including machine learning (especially models that uses imaging data) has proven promising for improving lung cancer prediction over traditional models (Leonard et all, 2025). <p>
