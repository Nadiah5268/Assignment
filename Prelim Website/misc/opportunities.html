        Opportunities in AI screening for Lung cancer:
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        In healthcare and medicine AI is capable of screening and detecting lung
        cancer earlier than traditional methods. This page focuses on the
        opportunities that AI provides in the battle against lung cancer.

      <h2 class="topic_subtitle">Early detection of lung cancer</h2>
      <p class="">
        Recent research suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) can be
        superior at helping diagnose lung cancer than traditional methods (Li et
        al., 2022; Leonard et al., 2025). Previous research shows that
        developments in imaging and sequencing technologies enable improvement
        in the study of lung cancer. Since the human brain is incapable of
        effectively handling and fully utilizing extensive amounts of data,
        Machine learning (a type of AI) will play a critical role in analyzing
        these vast and complex data through different perspectives (Li et al.,
        2022). Similar studies on machine learning based approaches show that AI
        can extensively characterize lung cancer by analyzing extensive
        accumulation of data through different perspectives (Li et al., 2020).
        It is also shown that AI has the potential to provide valuable insights
        for doctors and researchers in spotting lung cancer as early as possible
        (Li et al., 2020), giving patients a better chance of successful
        treatment. This further supports the idea that AI is capable of
        detecting lung cancer earlier than traditional methods.
        <br />
        A recent study by Leonard et al. (2025) compared the area under the
        curve (AUC) of the Traditional regression model and AI and showed that
        AI models consistently outperformed traditional regression models. This
        further supports how AI is more capable of helping diagnose lung cancer
        than traditional methods.

        On the other hand, Leonard et al. (2025) expressed that AI technology in
        helping lung cancer diagnosis is still immature, since it has increased
        risk in bias compared to traditional methods. Similarly, Li et al.
        (2025) also expressed the same risk of bias. Before AI can be
        implemented these risks have to be mitigated to prevent false positives
        and negatives in deferent demographics.

      <h2 class="topic_subtitle">
        Increased survival rates of cancer patients
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        Research has shown that AI has the potential to increase the survival
        rate of lung cancer patients (Choudhury et al., 2025; Li et al., 2022;
        Leonard et al., 2025). Firstly, the high mortality rate of lung cancer
        is frequently due to late diagnosis; accredited to its difficulty to
        identify. Skilled medical professionals have difficulty detecting cancer
        in its early stages due to the lack of correlation of characteristics
        between lymph node metastasis and cancer diagnosis (Choudhury et al.,
        2025). Furthermore, Choudhury et al. (2025) also shows that early and
        accurate diagnosis is essential to stop the progression of lung cancer
        and reduce mortality rates.
        <br />
        Artificial intelligence has the potential to assist in the detection of
        lung cancer in its initial stages (Li et al., 2022; Leonard et al.,
        2025). Retrieval and extraction of a suspicious nodule innate feature
        can be done automatically through Deep learning (Li et al., 2022).
        Additionally, Leonard et al. (2025) also shown that many AI models
        (especially models that use imaging data) have proven promising for
        improving lung cancer prediction over traditional models (Leonard et
        al., 2025).
        <br />
        Contrarily Li et al. (2022) mentions how machine learning (ML) currently
        lacks generalizability and robustness, limiting ML in clinical studies.
        For instance, the performance of ML algorithms is heavily affected by
        different datasets, which may be caused by random and/or irrelevant data
        resulting in unpredictable situations.

        <!--Paragraph 3 cost saving-->
      </p>

      <h2 class="topic_subtitle">Reduce cost of lung cancer treatment:</h2>
      <p class="">
        Treatment takes less resources when diagnosed early. This saves the
        resource each patient used and allows the saved resources to be used on
        another patient and overall makes the treatment less of a financial
        burden for patients. According to Yousefi et al., (2023) the mean direct
        medical cost of treating lung cancer is 4484.13 to 45,364.48 PPP
        (purchasing power parity based on USD 2016). This shows that lung cancer
        is incredibly costly which can impose significant financial burden on
        the patients and family. The study Kakushadze et al., (2017) showed how
        treatment for stage 1 of lung cancer is only 61.1% of stage 4 lung
        cancer. This shows that diagnosing lung cancer early can greatly reduce
        the cost of lung cancer treatment.

        Helps doctors and researchers find better treatments for lung cancer
      </h2>
      <p class="">
        Implementation of AI can reduce treatment costs for lung cancer
        patients. Research has shown that lung cancer treatment affordability in
        its initial stages is inferior to more advanced stages (Kakushadze et
        al., 2017; Nijs et al., 2024; Yousefi et al., 2023). Yousefi et al.
        (2023) have shown that an effective way to minimize costs associated
        with cancer is through early diagnosis and treatment. Likewise,
        Kakushadze et al. (2017) showed how the cost of treatment for stage 1
        lung cancer is 61.1% of stage IV lung cancer. Similarly, Nijs et al.
        (2024) showed that stage IV lung cancer is 157% more expensive for
        initial stage treatment than stage IA lung cancer.
        <br />
        AI could help in early diagnosis of lung cancer (Li et al., 2022;
        Leonard et al., 2025), which in turn leads to lower treatment cost since
        treatment for lung cancer is more affordable in its initial stages
        (Kakushadze et al., 2017; Nijs et al., 2024; Yousefi et al., 2023).
        <br />
        However, AI might not be capable of reducing cost overall due to many
        issues it has presented (Li et al., 2022; Leonard et al., 2025). As
        aforementioned, AI has a risk for bias (Li et al., 2022; Leonard et al.,
        2025), and lacks generalizability (Li et al., 2022) leading to issues
        which could offset how AI improves affordability through early
        diagnosis.
