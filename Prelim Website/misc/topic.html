      <h3 class="">Definition</h3>
      <p>
        There has been substantial advancement in artificial intelligence (AI)
        in recent years, enabling the possibility of utilizing AI for lung
        cancer detection in healthcare and medicine.
        <br />
        Thanks to recent developments in imaging and sequencing technologies,
        further advancement in the clinical study of lung cancer is enabled. To
        effectively utilize imaging data, machine learning (a type of AI) will
        play a crucial role in analyzing these vast and complex data through
        different perspectives (Li et al., 2022).
        <br />
        Lung cancer is a continuing worldwide health emergency that requires
        efficient detection to improve patients' outcomes. However, due to the
        non-intuitive correlation between certain characteristics and cancer
        diagnosis, early diagnosis remains challenging even for experienced
        medical professionals (Choudhury et al., 2025).
        <br />
        AI is a broad term that refers to the effort of imparting intelligence
        to machines. This definition is quite ambiguous as the concept of
        “intelligence” is quite subjective. AI does have the potential to help
        areas like patient quality of life improvement and better understanding
        of relationships between clinical characteristics and diseases (Stultz,
        2024).
        <br />
        Nowadays, a vast amount of research is focused on how AI could help
        improve lung cancer diagnosis for people that may suffer from this
        disease, so that effective treatment can be implemented.

      <h3>Justification</h3>
      <p>
        Lung cancer, the most common cancer worldwide, has resulted in over 1.8
        million deaths in 2022 alone (World Cancer Research Fund, 2020). Early
        detection of Lung cancer is crucial to the survivability (Choudhury et
        al., 2025; Li et al., 2022) and the affordability of treating cancer
        (Kakushadze et al., 2017).
        <br />
        Artificial intelligence has proven it can analyze large amounts of data
        to help with lung cancer diagnosis (Choudhury et al., 2025; Leonard et
        al., 2025; Li et al., 2022).
        <br />
        Despite the potential benefits, AI still has quite a few issues, like
        generalizability and robustness (Li et al., 2022). Additionally, AI also
        has a high risk of bias (Leonard et al., 2025) which could lead to miss
        diagnoses for people in different demographics.
        <br />
        As of now, AI technology is not yet mature enough to help with lung
        cancer diagnosis. To get it to that point, AI’s risk of bias would have
        to be addressed (Leonard et al., 2025) along with other issues. This
        brings us to the choices that must be made about data sets and more.
