        With the large advancements of artificial technology over the past
        decade, the healthcare industry is making progress to implement AI to
        help better diagnose ailments in patients.

        The global cancer rates are constantly rising and expected to increase
        more in the coming decades. Despite cancer affecting mostly older
        people, cancer can affect anyone of all ages, regardless of their health
        status.

        The cancer rates constantly rising and are expected to continue to rise.
        With lung cancer being the #1 cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
        there is a large amount of research and resources being used on AI to
        detect lung cancer as early as possible. This is because AI is better at
        detect cancer at the earlier stages when compared to traditional
        methods. It does this by looking for patterns in large amounts of data
        to find patterns that may resemble cancer. This can better increase the
        patientsâ€™ chances of survival.
